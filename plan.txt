Plan

Main (Starts simulation)

Ship (GameObject)
    Stores and Manages grid cells
    Also responsible for managing the fire?


Bot  (GameObject)
    Stores the current location
    Responsible for movement
    Location validation
    Automatic different ways of navigation

Simulation (Game Loop)
Steps:
1. Init Ship (create layout, place button, place bot, decide initial fire)
2. Start task 
    Decide which cell to move to next
    goto 3 if at button
    else fire keeps spreading
3. Task End Detection (sucess - bot arrives at button, fail - fire spread to bot/no path available)
    if bot reaches button, success
    if fire is at same location as bot, fail
    if no path is avaiable, faile
